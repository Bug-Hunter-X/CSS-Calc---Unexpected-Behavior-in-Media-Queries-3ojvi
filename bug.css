The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, the use of the `calc()` function with relative units inside a media query can lead to unexpected results.  For instance, if a media query uses `calc(100vw - 100px)` and the viewport width is small, the calculation may result in a negative value.  This would cause the media query to behave differently than anticipated or even cause unexpected layouts.
